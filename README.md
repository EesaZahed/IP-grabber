# IP-grabber
An IP grabber that grabs the client IP address and uploads it to a MongoDB Atlas database.

Works with [https://github.com/EesaZahed/IP-logger](https://github.com/EesaZahed/IP-logger).

To run this project, clone this project locally and install all the node modules. Change the `url` in `app.js` to your MongoDB Atlas URl. If you don't have one, go [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/) to learn more about making one.

Next, run `node app.js` to view the IP grabber.
